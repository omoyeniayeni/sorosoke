## About SoroSoke
SoroSoke listens to you as you speak on one of the several available engaging prompts 
without preparing for it and gives you a feedback on what you say. 

The feedbacks include:
- Time used
- Speed
- Numbers of pauses
- Duration of total pauses
- Most repeated words
- Other alternatives for most repeated words

## Other features implemented
- An archive to view the saved transcripts and analysis of the transcipts for each user.
- An archive which shows charts to visualise the speed, pauses, and pause duration over the user's last ten prompts, 
or as many prompts as the user has practiced (if less than ten).
- The ability to share the transcipts via Whatsapp, Twitter, email and SMS.
- The ability to permanently delete the transcripts.
